
# Inventory Application.

The reason of this project is to learn, practice, understand and dominate software development with the following frameworks/tools/methodologies:

*   JavaFX.
*   Hibernate.
*	Maven.
*	DAO Design pattern (upcoming).
*	MySQL.

Here you will find useful techniques and methodologies (or I hope so), such as:

*	Using property access instead field access in POJOS Clasess using Hibernate and JavaFX project (haven't seen any so far).
*	Use of HQL to manipulate data.
*	Event management inside TableView and TableColumn (edit cell and get calculations in another).

Hope you fork and practice with this repo too.
